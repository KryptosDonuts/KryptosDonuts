# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology enthusiast deeply engrossed in the world of server architecture, cluster deployment, and the integration of seamless services. My journey in tech has led me to explore the depths of containerization, with a keen focus on mastering Docker within self-hosted servers on VPS and AWS platforms.

## What I Do

- **Server and Cluster Deployment**: I thrive on designing and implementing scalable server infrastructures and clusters, ensuring high availability and performance.

- **Containerization with Docker**: Currently, I'm diving deep into Docker, learning to containerize applications to achieve consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## My Learning Path

- **Self-Hosted Servers**: By managing my own servers on VPS and AWS, I'm hands-on with deploying, monitoring, and optimizing applications in real-world scenarios.

- **Continuous Growth**: I'm committed to continuous learning, always exploring new technologies and practices that push the boundaries of what I can build and improve.
