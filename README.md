# Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a technology enthusiast deeply engrossed in the world of server architecture, cluster deployment, and the integration of seamless services. My journey in tech has led me to explore the depths of containerization, with a keen focus on mastering Docker within self-hosted servers on VPS, Proxmox and Kubernetes.

## What I Do

- **Server and Cluster Deployment**: I thrive on designing and implementing scalable server infrastructures and clusters, ensuring high availability and performance.

- **Containerization with Docker**: Currently, I'm diving deep into Docker, learning to containerize applications to achieve consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

- **K3S on Diverse Platforms**: Diving into the world of Kubernetes with K3S, I have successfully deployed clusters across various environments including Proxmox, and integrated key technologies such as Rancher for management, Longhorn for storage solutions, Traefik for load balancing, cert-manager and Argo CD for gitops. This journey has expanded my expertise in both container orchestration and the optimization of microservices.

## My Learning Path

- **Self-Hosted Servers**: By managing my own servers on VPS, Homelab running Proxmox, I'm hands-on with deploying, monitoring, and optimizing applications in real-world scenarios.

- **Continuous Growth**: I'm committed to continuous learning, always exploring new technologies and practices that push the boundaries of what I can build and improve.
